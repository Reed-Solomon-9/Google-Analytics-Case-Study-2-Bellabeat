This repository contains my analysis and SQL queries for the Google Data Analytics Bellabeat fitness tracker case study. The analysis uses [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) dataset from Kaggle, relating to Fitbit user information from 2016. The dataset contains 29 tables, and though the description on Kaggle says there are 30 users, the dataset contains 35 unique ID's.

I performed exploratory analysis in Google Sheets and Tableau, which are not included here as they are overly broad. 
My Final Analysis markdown file is the final report describing my analysis and conclusions. The Final Analysis is the only document that must be read to understand the outcomes of this case study.
